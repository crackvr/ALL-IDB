Fabio Scotti, Department of Information Technology - Università degli Studi di Milano

The annotation of ALL-IDB1 is as follows. The ALL-IDB1 image files are named with the notation ImXXX_Y.jpg where XXX is a 3-digit integer counter and Y is a boolean digit equal to 0 is no blast cells are present, and equal to 1 if at least one blast cell is present in the image. Please note that all images labeled with Y=0 are from for healthy individuals, and all images labeled with Y=1 are from ALL patients. Each image file ImXXX_Y.jpg is associated with a text file ImXXX_Y.xyc reporting the coordinates of the centroids of the blast cells, if any.
